Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and predicting subscription likelihood using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses improve customer retention strategies based on data-driven insights.

Key Steps & Methodology:
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset containing customer demographics, financial details, and previous interactions.
Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Model Development & Training:

Used Logistic Regression to classify whether a customer will subscribe or not.
Split features and target variable, then trained the model on the dataset.
Performance Evaluation & Predictions:

Achieved ~89.26% accuracy on training data.
Applied the trained model to test data and generated predictions.
Created a final submission file with customer IDs and predicted subscription status.
Outcome & Key Insights:
✅ High Accuracy: The model performed well, indicating that customer behavior and financial data strongly influence subscription decisions.
✅ Subscription Trends: Majority of predictions resulted in "no" subscriptions, suggesting potential gaps in customer engagement.
✅ Business Impact: Companies can use similar predictive models to target potential subscribers with personalized marketing strategies.
