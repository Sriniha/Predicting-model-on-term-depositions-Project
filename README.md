**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and predicting subscription likelihood using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses improve customer retention strategies based on data-driven insights.

**Key Steps & Methodology:**
**1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
   1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset containing customer demographics, financial details, and previous interactions.
   2. Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

**2. Model Development & Training:**
   1. Used Logistic Regression to classify whether a customer will subscribe or not.
   2. Split features and target variable, then trained the model on the dataset.

**3. Performance Evaluation & Predictions:**
   1. Achieved ~89.26% accuracy on training data.
   2. Applied the trained model to test data and generated predictions.
   3. Created a final submission file with customer IDs and predicted subscription status.

**Outcome & Key Insights:**

✅ **High Accuracy:** The model performed well, indicating that customer behavior and financial data strongly influence subscription decisions.

✅ **Subscription Trends:** Majority of predictions resulted in "no" subscriptions, suggesting potential gaps in customer engagement.

✅ **Business Impact:** Companies can use similar predictive models to target potential subscribers with personalized marketing strategies.
